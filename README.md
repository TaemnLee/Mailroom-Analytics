# Mailroom Analytics (Demo)

This repo contains the **analysis and visualization code** I wrote for analyzing  
100,000+ package records in Denison University’s mailroom.

For confidentiality, the real dataset is not included. Instead, you can generate or substitute your own CSVs to run the analysis pipeline and see the visualizations.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/mailroomAnalysis.py` → data cleaning, aggregation, and export of counts
- `src/mailroomViz.ipynb` → Jupyter notebook with visualizations (monthly, weekly, carrier trends)
- `.gitignore` → ensures raw CSVs, reports, and private data are never committed

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

### 🔒 Note

This repository is a demo version.
The real project was built on private university package records.
All code here is authentic, but datasets in mailroomData/ are intentionally excluded.
