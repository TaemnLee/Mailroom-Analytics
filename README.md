# Mailroom Analytics (Sanitized Demo)

This project demonstrates my work analyzing **100,000+ mailroom package records** at Denison University.  
For confidentiality, the dataset here is synthetic (randomly generated), but the **code and analysis workflow** are identical to the original.

## Features
- Cleaned and structured raw CSV data
- Visualized delivery volume by month, carrier distribution, and weekday traffic
- Proposed advanced analytics (class-year breakdown, package size trends, seasonal forecasting)

## Tech Stack
Python · Pandas · Matplotlib  

## Example Visualizations
